# Project Test README

## Description
This repository contains the required test that demonstrates my skills in fullstack development. For questions A and B, I took the opportunity to show my frontend skills and created an interactive interface that shows the solutions to the proposed exercises. For question C contains a TypeScript implementation of a Geo Distributed Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache with real-time data replication. The cache is designed to optimize data access and minimize latency, especially in distributed systems.

## Instructions questions A and B
Follow these steps to explore the frontend interface and its features:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev

```

Interact with the interface to see the visual representation of the exercise solutions.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript
- ReactJs
- MaterialUI
- Vite
